Previously, my website was done fully by hand using HTML and CSS, with just a little PHP and some JS for testing.
As of 2021, this website has been fully remade using ReactJS, to make it much easier to maintain. 
The original purpose of the website was for me to learn different things, by either making the website, or implementing new features.
Changing it to ReactJS allows me to learn more about ReactJS, Typescript, and SASS.

### Find the NEW website at [AntTes.com](http://anttes.com), and the old version HTML/CSS at [Old.AntTes.com](http://old.anttes.com).
###### NOTE: Some features in the OLD version may not work. Features here will most likely not be fixed or updated. If there's a feature from the old website you're looking for, please contact me. Some features can be found using old.anttes.com/DIRECTORY.
